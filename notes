/**

Bugs:
Random Ip repeats a randomly chosen IP (?) a couple of times in a row.


Improvements:
TimeToKill should be the exact time instance is going to die
Socks5 over ssh is not secure for firefox for some reason?

Stuff to implement:

Servers to run on the instances.
Servers need to know other instances that are alive.
Tunnel set up on local machine.
Tunnel set up on the servers.
Updating, Setting up, and running servers on aws instances?
