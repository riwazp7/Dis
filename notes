/**

Bugs:
Random Ip repeats a randomly chosen IP (?) a couple of times in a row.
TimeToKill should be the exact time instance is going to die

Improvements:
Maybe not kill for some time after instance is supposed to be dead?

Stuff to implement:

Generate path.
Debug setting path.
Updating, Setting up, and running servers on aws instances?
