/**

Bugs:
Random Ip repeats a randomly chosen IP (?) a couple of times in a row.
TimeToKill should be the exact time instance is going to die

Improvements:
Maybe not kill for some time after instance is supposed to be dead?

Stuff to implement:

Servers to run on the instances.
Servers need to know other instances that are alive.
Tunnelling ...is getting complicated.
Tunnel setup on local machine.
Tunnel setup on remote.
Updating, Setting up, and running servers on aws instances?
